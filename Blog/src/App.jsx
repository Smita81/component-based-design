    <br/><br/>         React is a JavaScript library used for building fast and scalable user interfaces for websites and applications. 
 <br/>It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading a page.  
 <br/> React provides state-of-the-art functionality and is an excellent choice for developers looking for an easy-to-use and highly productive JavaScript framework. 
 <br/>Using React, you can build complex UI interactions that communicate with the server in record time with JavaScript-driven pages.
